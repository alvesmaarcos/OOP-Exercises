# Object-Oriented Programming exercices
This repository contais exercices focused on improving my knowledge about OOP. All the programs were built in the University, during the discipline of Object-Oriented Programming.

This discipline is not finished until February, 2025, which means a couple of new exercices will be placed in the next weeks.

My experience learning OOP is very positive. Before my classes started, i didn't know the reason why other students kept calling it so important. Nowadays, my thoughts are different. The way we need to merge programming concepts in real life applying them to "Objects" makes the things clearer, sets an objective with ease.
